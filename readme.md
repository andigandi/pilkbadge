# PILKBADGE

Buranyaaa! If you love ironically drinking pilk (50% pepsi, 50% milk mix), or like anime women, this badge is for you!

This is a fun project we did at hackerspace. @weaselcore did the art, @critbit made it into a PCB.

After inserting the bottles, the eyes glow up. The bottles stay in place

To assmeble this, you need 2 LEDs (mounted upside down), 2x 0603 470R resistors, 2x 4pin 2.54mm headers, and a generic CR2032 battery holder.

There's also an option for using a LiPo charger PCB instead of CR2032 holder, but this is not yet supported, nor advised.

More documentation and repo cleanup will be done after 37C3.
